# First Django Project
First project built with Django and deployed to Heroku. I used this django tutorial (https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/intro/tutorial01/) to create a polls application 
with comments on the polls. 

Please do not copy the code and use it without referencing this repository. It could be an honor violation for you assignment if you are a student taking CS3240 at UVA.
