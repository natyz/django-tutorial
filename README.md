# django-tutorial
First project built with Django and deployed to Heroku. I used this django tutorial (https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/intro/tutorial01/) to create a polls application 
with comments on the polls. 

Please do not copy the code and use it without referencing this repository. It could be an honor violation for you assignment.
